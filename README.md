README for Cybersecurity Research

Overview

This repository contains my research in cybersecurity, focusing on various aspects of cyber defense, threat detection, and response. The goal of this research is to develop effective strategies and tools to enhance the security posture of organizations and individuals. This README provides an overview of the research areas, key findings, and sample Python code used in the analysis.

Research Areas

	1.	Threat Detection and Analysis: Developing methods to identify and analyze cyber threats using machine learning and data analytics.
	2.	Incident Response: Creating frameworks and tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of incident response teams.
	3.	Vulnerability Assessment: Building automated tools to scan for and identify vulnerabilities in systems and applications.
	4.	Cyber Defense Strategies: Exploring best practices and innovative approaches to protect against cyber attacks.

Key Findings

	•	Machine Learning for Threat Detection: Implementing machine learning models can significantly improve the accuracy of threat detection compared to traditional methods.
	•	Automated Incident Response: Automation can reduce the time to respond to incidents, minimizing potential damage and recovery time.
	•	Continuous Vulnerability Scanning: Regular scanning and patch management are critical to maintaining a secure environment.
	•	Defense in Depth: A multi-layered security approach is essential to defend against sophisticated cyber threats.

Sample Python Code

Below is a sample Python script used in the research for threat detection using a machine learning model. This script trains a simple decision tree classifier to detect malicious network activity based on a dataset.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('network_traffic.csv')

# Preprocess data
# Assume the dataset has features 'feature1', 'feature2', ..., 'featureN' and target 'label'
X = data[['feature1', 'feature2', 'feature3', 'feature4', 'feature5']]
y = data['label']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Initialize the model
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
print('Classification Report:')
print(report)
